Starting Point
==============

Starting Point CSS - a minimal but good-looking html5- and css3-template for web sites and web applications

Why should I use this?
----------------------

I got tired of using large CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation. The main problem I had
was that they tried to do too much - which often resulted in unexpected bugs and slow development
because I had to search through a lot of CSS to find all the rules that applied to my elements.

Starting Point is meant to be overwritten
-----------------------------------------

Starting Point just gives you a nice place to start. It will still be your friend if you
try to overwrite some of it. It is actually designed to be replaced with your
own awesome CSS as your project go along.


Starting Point will never be big
--------------------------------

It will focus on common elements like navigation/menus, displaying content and
styling forms and buttons. This means you can spend less time on bootstrapping
your webpage or app and more time on customizing the parts that really matter.


Browser support
---------------
Latest versions of Safari, Firefox, Chrome. Internet Explorer version 8 and later.


Documentation and demos will be added to [Github pages](http://davidelbe.github.io/starting-point/).
